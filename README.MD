# PostgreSQL Buffer Replacement with LRU Policy

## Database Systems Implementation Project from NUS

This is a project to replace the default buffer replacement policy in PostgreSQL with LRU (Least Recently Used) policy. The aim is to improve the overall performance of PostgreSQL by optimizing the buffer cache management. This is done by implementing a doubly linked list (LRU stack)
